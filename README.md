# EventRingerBot

A WIP attempt to make a bot the will dm anyone with a given role who isn't in the server's voice channels.
Useful to get your team together when its time to go. Only for use by those with permissions to manage the server.

Step 0: $setup [group name without @]
Step 1: $ring' in the server and it will ring the group you set early

It will keep the group you named as it's calling group.
